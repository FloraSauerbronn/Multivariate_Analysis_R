# Multivariate_Analysis_R
I took a subject in my master's degree called multivariate analysis with R. We developed several routines using statistical analysis with different datasets for different samples. In the end, we created our own analysis project, using daily data on wave height, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen from a buoy from the SinCosta project.
