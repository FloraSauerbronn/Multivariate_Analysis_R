# Multivariate_Analysis_R
I took a subject in my master's degree called multivariate analysis with R. We developed several routines using statistical analysis with different datasets for different samples. In the end, we created our own analysis project, using daily data on wave height, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen from a buoy from the SinCosta project.


Here you will find several scripts with their respective CSV data sets, great for training and practice.

The files contained in the name SINCOSTA were the ones I downloaded from the Brazilian buoy program website. And which I used in my final project.

The file that has "_process" was treated by me via Python, removing some collection errors from the equipment used, such as outliars or NaNs.

My final project is called "Flora_Sauerbronn.

Enjoy :)
