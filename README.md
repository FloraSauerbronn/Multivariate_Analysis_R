# Multivariate Analysis with R

Welcome to the **Multivariate Analysis with R** project! This repository showcases the routines and analyses developed during my master's degree course on multivariate analysis. Throughout the course, we employed various statistical techniques on diverse datasets, culminating in a comprehensive analysis project utilizing daily data on wave height, chlorophyll levels, and dissolved oxygen from a buoy associated with the SinCosta project.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you will find several scripts along with their corresponding CSV datasets, perfect for training and practice in multivariate analysis.

### Data Sources

The datasets contained in the `SINCOSTA` folder were downloaded from the Brazilian Buoy Program website and were utilized in my final project. 

### Data Processing

The files with "_process" in their names were cleaned and processed using Python. During this process, I addressed several collection errors from the equipment, including outliers and NaN values, to ensure data integrity for analysis.

### Final Project

My final project is titled **Flora Sauerbronn**, and it encapsulates the findings and methodologies applied throughout the course.

## Getting Started

To use the scripts and datasets in this repository:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

bash
```
cd Multivariate_Analysis_R
```
3. Explore the scripts and datasets to practice and enhance your skills in multivariate analysis.

Enjoy!

Feel free to explore, experiment, and utilize the resources provided. Happy analyzing!
